t's been about a month and twenty day
And we're going 'round and 'round playing silly games
Now you're saying, "Slow it down, not right now"
Then you wink at me and walk away

[Pre-Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be known
Hold on, don't go
Touching and teasing me, telling me "no"
But this time I need to feel you

[Verse 2]
Movida was the club on the Saturday
You actin' like a diva sayin' you don't wanna pay
It's gotta be ya feisty style, raised eyebrow
I love it when you look at me that way
Now we're in, you order a Mojito at the bar
You re-apply lippy 'cause it came off on the glass
The DJ plays your favourite song, Kanye's on
Now ya beckoning for me to dance
